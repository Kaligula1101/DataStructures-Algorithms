// LIFO (last-in-first-out)
// A stackâ€™s purpose is to limit the number of ways to access your data
//
// Examples of using stacks:
// *iOS uses the navigation stack to push and pop view controllers into and out of view.
// *Memory allocation uses stacks at the architectural level. Memory for local variables is also managed using a stack.
// *Search and conquer algorithms, such as finding a path out of a maze, use stacks to facilitate backtracking.
